# Handoff Template

> **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (for human or AI generating a new handoff):**
>
> 1.  **Create a brand-new Markdown file directly within the `SOP/` folder.**
> 2.  **Use a clear, descriptive name for the new file** (e.g., `Handoff-LoginBug-MobileLayout.md`).
>     _Do NOT include dates or times in the filename._
> 3.  _Never overwrite or rename existing hand-off documents._
> 4.  **Ensure all file paths listed below are clickable relative markdown links** (e.g., `[filename.ext](../path/to/filename.ext)`).
